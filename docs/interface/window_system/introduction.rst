Once pySTXM has completely started you should 
see a screen like the image below, this is the pySTXM interface for STXM datacollection.

   The default startup pySTXM window.


Interface Elements
==================

A screen is organized into 7 regions each containing information of a similar type
being organized onto the following panes.

- Detectors
- Scan pluggin and Preferences
- Scan control and status
- Data Visualization
- Collected Data
- Device control and feedback
- Log Window and embedded console


User Interface Principles (borrowed from Blender)
=================================================

Non-Overlapping
   The UI is designed to allow you to view all relevant options and tools at a glance
   without pushing or dragging editors around.

Non-Blocking
   Tools and interface options do not block the user from any other parts of pySTXM.
   pySTXM typically does not use pop-up boxes
   (requiring users to fill in data before running an operation).

Non-Modal Tools
   Tools can be accessed efficiently without taking time to select between different tools.
   Many tools use consistent and predictable, mouse and keyboard actions for interaction.
