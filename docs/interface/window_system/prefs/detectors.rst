	On the Configured Detector Preferences panel you will find the supported detectors listed. 

This is still a work in progress but the idea is that the user would enable or disable a detector by clicking
the checkbox beside the detector, if enabled that detector's data would be included in the data file.

	The detail buttons are stubbed in for future use

Only enabled detectors will appear in the data file. Beside the detector enable/disable checkbox is 
a **Details** button. The details button raises a details window for that detector where the user can 
configure a detail specific to that detector, *this will likely change in the future to the button simply 
loading the details panel into a "details sub area" on the preferences panel.*
