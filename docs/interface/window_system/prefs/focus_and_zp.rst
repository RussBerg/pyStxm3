The Focus and Zoneplate pane also allows the user to specify which zoneplate and OSA they are currently using.
There are currently 7 pre-defined zoneplate's to choose from and they are defined by the following fields:
	
**Zoneplate definition fields**
		- Diameter (um)
		- Central Stop size (um)
		- Outer zone size (um)
		- A1 value
		
There are 5 pre-defined OSA definitions with the only parameter being the inner diameter of the Order Sorting Aperture.
