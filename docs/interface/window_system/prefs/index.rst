	:align:	right

This panel is where all preferences will be based from. 
The pulldown box in the top left corner 
is where the user selects which preferences pane they want to display. Any new 
preference panels that get create and saved in the **cls/applications/pyStxm/preferences** 
directory will be automatically picked up on next restart of the application.
