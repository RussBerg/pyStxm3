The Coarse Goni Image scan is used to  provide an overview of the Goni sample.

To perform a Coarse Goni Image scan:

	1 - Select the **Coarse Goni Scan** tab.

	2 - Use the 2D selection tool, select an area (e.g. 800x100um) on the screen centered around (0, 0).
	**The scan region can also be set by entering the center and range for X and Y in the fields on the Coarse Goni Scan pane.**

	3 - With the center and range set, enter the number of points or step size for each X and Y in the **# Points** or **Step** fields for X and Y (Sometimes less number of points on Y can save scan time for the initial sample navigation).

	4 - Enter an appropriate Dwell time (ms).
	
	5 - Press the **Start** button on the **Scan Control** pane.
	
	6 - Perform a Focus Scan on the sample and then repeat steps 1-5.
